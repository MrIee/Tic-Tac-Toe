##<a name="about"></a>About
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a game tradionally played by 2 players using a 3 by 3 grid. Players take turn placing a nought/circle or a cross/x on a square in the grid. The game continues until one player has placed 3 of his/her noughts/crosses in a row. The row can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.


##<a name="approach"></a>Approach
I started by creating a javascript object and determining the variables and functions that would be required to run the game.

Once the logic was fleshed out enough, I linked it with jQuery manipulating the dom.
